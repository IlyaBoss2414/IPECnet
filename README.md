# IPECnet: ML model for predicting the area of water solubility of interpolyelectrolyte complexes

This work is devoted to the development of the world's first machine learning-based model for predicting the area of existence of water-soluble interpolyelectrolyte complexes for solving biomedical problems. A new approach is proposed that takes into account both the physico-chemical properties of polyelectrolytes and the chemical structures of their monomeric units. The developed approach is universal and can be used to predict the properties of multicomponent systems of a different chemical nature. The results of the work were applied to select the optimal composition of interpolyelectrolyte complexes for various environmental conditions in order to create bactericidal coatings.

# Aim and tasks
The purpose of this work is to develop a model for determining the stability range of interpolyelectrolyte complexes formed by various pairs of polyelectrolytes depending on environmental conditions. The creation of such a model will reduce the selection time of the IPEC composition for solving scientific and applied problems and identify the key factors influencing their formation.

Tasks:
1. Preprocess data
2. Develop a neural network  
3. Compare approaches based on deep learning

# Data
The data on the phase stability of IPEC are the curves of turbidimetric titration, a method for measuring the intensity of the luminous flux passing through a solution containing suspended particles. An increase in the turbidity of the solution indicates the formation of aggregates caused by the phase separation of the IPEC. As an indicator of the stable existence of a polyelectrolyte complex, according to the approach developed in the field, the critical value of the molar charge ratio of lyophilizing (in excess of molar ratios of links) to blocking (in short supply) polymers was chosen  - the value of phi* in the graph below.

The dataset consists of 296 pairs – polyanion/ polycation pairs with known physico-chemical properties of monomers, the chemical formula of the monomer link, synthesis conditions and target parameters – indicators of the stable existence of the polyelectrolyte complex.  The physicochemical properties of polyelectrolytes were partially obtained from the chemical structure of monomers using the rdkit.Chem library.Descriptors.

# Models
The polyBERT transformer model was used as a basis for creating polymer fingerprints based on the structure of their monomer units [21]. This model is used to predict the properties of polymers based on their structure, as well as to generate new potentially synthesizable polymers based on specified properties. At the moment, polyBERT is the most advanced model for creating polymer embeddings. polyBERT accepts the monomer structure in canonical form, the so-called pSMILES, and provides embedding at the output.
To solve our problem, the following several models have been developed and studied.

1) No chemistry model
To solve the classification problem, a model based on physical-chemistry features of monomer and features of the environment was investigated. Features of environment and physico-chemical features on monomers were converted into a single vector with size (188 x 1), which was given to the input of the model. The model consists of three fully connected layers separated by ReLU() as an activation function and Dropout for fighting overfitting. The detailed structure of the model is presented on the no_chemistry_model.py


2) IPECnet light 
Next model was constructed based on the concatenation of all the physical-chemistry features of monomer and features of environment IPEC representations and embeddings of the chemical structures of monomers of lyophilizing and blocking polymers.
Each polymer's embeddings are created using polyBERT and then concatenated. These embeddings are passed through a fully connected layer to reduce the dimensionality. In addition, the normalized physico-chemical features of the polymers are also passed through another fully connected layer. This results in an embedding of the same size as the structure embeddings.
Next, both these representations are concatenated and passed through a third fully connected layer. At the output of this layer, we get a target value. The qualitative structure of the network is presented on Figure 1. The code of model is presented on the IPECnet_light.py

3) IPECnet 
In this model, the physicochemical features of each polymer are paired with the chemical structure of the monomer. The normalized physicochemical features of each polymer are passed through a fully connected layer and concatenated with an embedding of each polymer created using PolyBERT. Then, the generalized embedding of each polymer is passed through another fully connected layer and concatenated with the embedding of another polymer at the output. A vector consisting of the remaining features that characterize the environment in which IPEC formation occurs is added to the combined embedding. Finally, the vector is again passed through fully connected layers to obtain a normalized target. The qualitative structure of the network is shown in Figure 2. The Transfer Learning approach was used to train the models. polyBERT weights were frozen. AdamW was chosen as the optimizer, with 200 epochs. Binary Cross Entropy was used as a loss function. The code of model is presented on the IPECnet.py

4) IPECnet without chemistry
‘IPEC_net without chemistry’ is a model based on the principle of independent consideration of the properties of polymer components, but without taking into account the embeddings of their chemical structure. The qualitative structure of the network is shown in Figure 3. The code of model is presented on the IPECnet_without_chemistry.py
